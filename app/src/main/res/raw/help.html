<h3>Recipe list</h3>
<h4>Add recipe</h4>

<h3>Recipe detail</h3>
<p>The detail view allows you to adjust the recipe in a simple and easy way . Moisturizing bar indicates the dough hydration and helps you to adjust this paremeter at any time. Others parameters like dough weight, flour and liquid quantity and preferment hydration is also indicated. When editing ingredients it is convenient to classify them into three groups:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reference ingredients (Flours).</li>
    <li>Liquid ingredients.</li>
    <li>Solid ingredients.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reference ingredients are used to adjust the remaining ingredients and calculate the hydration rate. When creating a new recipe, flour is added in the first position . This ingredient is also tagged as base ingredient and is essential to adjust the remaining reference ingredients. You can not remove the base flour. Cereals flour are considered reference ingredients. Liquid ingredients like water, milk, oil, eggs directly influence the hydration of the dough. The ingredients that are not reference neither liquid are considered solids. It is very important to consider this classification to properly prepare the recipe.</p>
<h4>Add ingredients</h4>
<p>New ingredients are added pressing the "+ " button in the toolbar. Write the name, put the percentage or amount, according to the selected adjust mode setting and mark if it is a reference or liquid ingredient (Don´t mark anything if ingredient doesn´t fall under any of the two groups) . Pressing the OK button will be added to the list of ingredients . Recipe is adjusted automatically.</p>
<h4>Edit ingredients</h4>
<p>To edit an ingredient just click on it in the list of ingredients and the dialog box will appear. After making the desired changes, press the OK button to confirm the changes.</p>
<h4>Remove ingredients</h4>
<p>To remove an ingredient, keep it pressed until the dialog box appears. Recipe is recalculated after deleting the ingredient.</p>
<h4>Add preferment</h4>
<p>You may insert a preferment (previously created) in a recipe. By incorporating preferment in the recipe, it will be inserted as if it were an ingredient and the amounts of flour and water will be subtracted to the recipe in order to maintain the proportions. The other preferment ingredients (neither flour neither water) will be taken into account to determine the final weight of the recipe. To add a preferment, choose "add preferment option" from the menu and select the type and percentage/amount. The preferment appears in the list of ingredients and its hydration rate will be show in the upper right corner. If you want to change the preferment, you must perform the change in the recipe that defines the preferment and add it again to the recipe that uses it (previously erasing the previous one)</p>
